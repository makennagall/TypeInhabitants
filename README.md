# TermInhabitants
Planning:

Take in term of form:
V: for every
variables
Parentheses as necessary

VX.VY.(X->X->Y)->X->Y

1. turn into lambda calculus term:
  \X.\Y.\a:(X->X->Y).\b:X.abb

  for every term in a except for the last term, is there a corresponding variable that has that type. b has type x. Does the final variable in the first type match the overall type variable?

  Implement counting number of types

  Infinite type check
